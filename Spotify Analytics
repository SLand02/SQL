# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. The following are quetions I asked about the given data, and the SQL I used to answer them.

/* What is the energy rating of each artist?*/
select artist_name, avg(energy) as energy_rating
from spotifydata
group by artist_name
order by energy_rating desc;
 
/* What are the top 5 danceable songs from this list?*/
select artist_name as artist, track_name as song, danceability
from spotifydata
order by danceability desc
limit 5;


/*Which artist has the most songs on the Spotify Top 50?*/
select count(track_name) as numofsongs, artist_name as artist
from spotifydata
group by artist_name
order by numofsongs desc;

/* Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?*/
select artist_name as artist, popularity
from spotifydata
order by popularity desc
limit 10;

/*What Key do artists tend to use?*/
select artist_name as artist, track_name as song, song_key as key 
from spotifydata
order by artist;
